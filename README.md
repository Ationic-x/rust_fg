The following game is a "failed" adaptation of [Ikemen-GO](https://github.com/ikemen-engine/Ikemen-GO), but written in Rust over a time span of three months, with zero prior knowledge of Rust.

The project had to be completed within that time frame because it was a final year project (TFG) I did during my Multiplatform Application Development (DAM) course in Spain. That’s also the reason why the documentation and comments were translated from English to Spanish.

This project remained unfinished in my private repositories for quite some time, as it contains a lot of rookie mistakes—from how I structured the game logic and unit tests, to the choice of using the Piston framework (which I regret), and even issues with color rendering due to the Gamma function (things tend to look darker than they should on certain computers).

Despite that, after some time, I believe this code has some interesting aspects that might help certain people, even though it's quite unlikely that I’ll fix or improve it in the future.

In any case, at most I'm considering creating a version 2.0 using directly libraries like WGPU (essentially building my own engine), or with the Bevy framework, which I'm currently learning in order to continue making games in Rust.

Please don’t pull your hair out too much if you come across code that doesn’t follow best practices.
